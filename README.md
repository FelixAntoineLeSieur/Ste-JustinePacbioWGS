# Ste-JustinePacbioWGS
Pacbio data processing, including Preanalysis, WGS Analysis and Post-analysis


We describe here a workflow for analyzing and processing data received from the Revio PacBio sequencer acquired by the CHU Sainte-Justine. 

## Data processing
![Diag](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/488dfa31-3974-43fd-ba15-68190e756015)
Once out of the sequencer, the long-read sequencing data is automatically transfered on a in-house smrtlink server, for temporary storage. 
Since storage and computing resources are limited on this server, we transfer the data to a cluster of the Alliance, [Narval](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Narval).
\
From there, we pre-process the data with the scripts included here in [Preprocessing](#Pre-analysis). Then, the analysis itself is done using PacBio's [WGS pipeline](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/HiFi-human-WGS-WDL). Note that I have my own fork of this pipeline [here](https://github.com/FelixAntoineLeSieur/HiFi-human-WGS-WDL). It contains some minor changes aimed at making the pipeline usable in the Narval environment.
\
Once the data has been processed by the WGS pipeline, we want to setup tertiary analysis, primarily through the GeneYX website, though different analysis and reports will likely be added later. 
This will described here in [Post-analysis](#Post-analysis)

## Requirements
Using the scripts here requires access to GeneYX, Emedgene and Phenotips. Access information and paths must be defined in the config (by default named .myconf.json).
**TODO** [The specific tool versions will be described here later] 

### File and directories
My fork of the analysis pipeline is available [here](https://github.com/FelixAntoineLeSieur/HiFi-human-WGS-WDL) and includes installation instruction. 

We need the input files which are contained in the **run_path** given in the config. \
**run path** is a directory containing all the runs separated by run ID, as obtained by the Revio sequencer. This ID follows: r84196_{run_Start_Date}_{run_Start_Time}. Each of these folders contain subdirectories for each sequencing plate (1_A01, 1_B01...), each representing a single sample. Samples are further divided in subdirectories containing data related to the sample, the ones required by the scripts are in the subdirectories hifi_reads (contains the HiFi reads in unaligned BAM format), pb_format (contains metadata related to the sample, including the sample_name) \
**ref_path** is usually included in the HiFi-human-WGS-WDL pipeline as a template, in which the user must set paths to a resource bundle available here:\
[<img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14027047.svg" alt="10.5281/zenodo.14027047">](https://zenodo.org/records/14027047) \
**tertiary_maps** is generated in a similar way to ref_path. \
**sample_sheet_path** is the link to the directory that will contain the pipeline samplesheets (in .json) and the batch files (in .txt).\
**Outputs** is unused for now, it will contain the outputs of the Analysis part \
**sample_list** is the CSV file that contains the metadata of samples retrieved by Preanalysis/getSamples.py.  All desired samples must be in this list before the sample sheets can be generated by Preanalysis/singletonSampleSheet or Preanalysis/jointCallSampleSheet.py \
 


### Config
The config file follows this format:
```
{
	"Emedgene":
		{
			"username":"XXX",
			"password":"YYY",
			"endpoint":"https://chusaintejustine.emedgene.com"
		},
	"Phenotips":
		{
			"auth":"Basic XXX",
			"secret":"YYY",
			"endpoint":"https://chusj.phenotips.com"
		},
	"GeneYX":
		{
			"server": "https://analysis.geneyx.com",
			"apiUserId": "XXX",
			"apiUserKey": "YYY"
		},
	"Paths":
		{
			"run_path": "/home/felixant/projects/ctb-rallard/COMMUN/PacBioData/",
			"ref_maps": "/home/felixant/scratch/MINIWDL/HiFi-human-WGS-WDL/GRCh38.ref_map.v2p0p0.tsv",
			"sample_sheet_path": "/home/felixant/scratch/MINIWDL/SampleSheet/",

		}
}
```
Where the username and password are specified for each platform and the paths to the following:
**run_path**:
